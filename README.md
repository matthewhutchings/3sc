# 3SC PHP Task

### Getting Started

* Clone this repository
* Run `composer install` from the project directory
* Commit your progress
* You'll need php 5.6+ (ideally 7.1)

### Task
You will be building a simple ~~image~~ cat gif storage system.

Some interfaces have been provided in the `/src` directory. Your solution
should implement each of these and provide usage examples which may be run
from the command line.

The solution should demonstrate manipulation of the filesystem using the 
images provided in the `/images` directory.

### Important

Your solution should demonstrate use of OO design principles, particularly
[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) and you
may choose to use any additional design patterns.

Additionally you may wish to make use of features provided by
[Standard PHP Library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php), however this is
optional.

Your solution is not required to demonstrate uploading of files, and does
not require a HTML front end. It should include a usage example that may be run from
the command line to demonstrate reading and manipulation of the filesystem.

Some sample images have been provided in the `/images` directory.

### Tests
Your solution should include some unit tests. Some examples have been provided already.

To run tests, run the following commands:

```
composer install

./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
